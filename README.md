# R2H-Installer-Plugin
This plugin installs all found packages in the packages folder instead of using a package xml. This makes development
and building packages a lot easier. Feel free to use or improve this code.

### Requirements
This plugin requires PHP 7.0 or higher and Joomla! 3.8 or higher.
